1.3   Business Need

Green Man's Pantry, and its Stakeholders, have chosen to replace its ERP system, and move into a modern EDI approach of handling their procurement platform, with use of mobile application technology, providing planning and project management, sourcing and contract management, supplier management, order management, invoicing management, shipping management, audit logs, and custom reports, optimizing the business processes of Green Man's Pantry by primarily integrating mobility, 
cloud services, and database technologies into business processes through the production of web-based applications that will be targeted for tablet and mobile use, as well as a web-based portal—partnering with Shade Leaf Engineering & Consulting, to streamline the process to reduce financial overhead, and so that supplier issues can be tracked more efficiently through a single, easy to use interfaced, web portal—with Tablets & Smartphones being the critical platforms. 

This project will reduce operational overhead and help eliminate redundant and inefficient workforce, while also speeding up order processing response times, improve invoicing and shipment tracking, generate custom reports, sync sourcing opportunities, and manage supplier information, projecting a substantial increase in revenue, while also increasing Shade Leaf Engineering & Consulting's presence within the industry. The mobile application will allow real-time updates of customer information, shipment delivery, and order tracking so real-time changes may be performed. Making these changes on the fly, the customer will get correct orders on time and reduce the cost of shipping, return merchandise, or losing it to spoilage or other product damages, while eliminating the process of verifying carbon copies. 

1.4   Budget Analysis

The project budget analysis includes complete provisions for plan-vs-actual estimates for the implementation of a new mobile application electronic data interchange platform service—the project executive will hold monthly, and quarterly follow-up meetings to discuss variances and course corrections. The project initially projected planned development costs of designing new databases, software architecture for web application development, and the promotion of start-up technologies at around $1,600,000.00—the initial budgeting management process was projected through a top-down approach where the product owner, consultant, stakeholders, and managers planned the years project portfolio, estimating the number of resources required for developing a rough project timeline and cost estimate, giving the project's lifecycle a kick-start with funding resources. 

As the initial budgeting management process was projected through a top-down approach, the project was also moved into a bottom-up approach, where the budgeting was refined, identifying operating system conflicts and developing detailed project budgets, schedules and monthly forecasts, based on direct input from the not only the core team, but also the development team--estimating actual projected costs at around $2,100,000.00. With the bottom-up approach guiding the steering committee, 
the project executive will begin sending up approval requests, for funds, that have not been fully depleted on specific expense types first, to be directed towards other expenses that may arise, such as, expenses towards project delays—the bottom-up approach will continue over the course of the project life cycle unless a mandatory funding limit is enforced. 

The accompanying table has been provided outlining the actual budgeted costs of the project, which includes refined work packages/chunks, with accurate estimates at a detailed level. Included in the projected actual costs is a budget contingency that is currently recognized as a separate project cost estimate type, equaling fifteen percent of the total estimated cost of the projected software development budget that has been estimated to be accurate estimates. The idea of the budget contingency is that if the project runs into delays, that incur additional expenses, these additional expenses can be taken from the contingency plan, with a memo request for extension/approval, accounting for the purchase, the funds spent, and account drawn from. Any left-over budgeting funds will start the allocation of extra funds to cover uncertainties and improve the chances that the project can be completed within the time frame originally specified. Sometime during the system testing phase, management will determine if additional contractor/support will be needed for architectural design of the software mobile application, for successful project completion. If the contingency budget funds are not used throughout the software development lifecycle of this project, then the funds will be re-allocated, into the next development phase of the web development application services, after the completion of the mobile application development phase.

1.5   Project Team Management

In the event that conflicts arise during the development of the mobile application between personnel, the project executive will be the first source of resolution, using tactics such as mediating conflicts employing diffusion or confrontation solutions—arbitrating conflicts by imposing judgement on warring parties using company policies for solutions—accepting conflicts in knowing that some personalities of project team members simply don't jive, or by eliminating the conflict by critically evaluating the nature and severity of the conflict and either transferring the team member or removing the team member from the project all together. The project executive understands the project has scarce resources, which may lead to differentiation among other department leads, and uncertainty with lines of authority with the progress of development of the project. The project executive will address all conflicts through mediation, arbitration, control, acceptance or elimination, unless the conflict cannot be resolved and needs to be handled through an alternative functional department.

1.6   Organizational Structure

A strong matrix structure has been selected for this software development project. This structure is the most functional for Shade Leaf Engineering & Consulting as Green Man’s Pantry has given full autonomy of the software development life cycle to the independent consulting company. The lead project executive has been granted full authority over the course of the project and the budget, so that in, not only is their mediations between executives and the software engineers, but so that the software engineers also fall into a hierarchy management structure for reporting purposes. This will allow the project executive to control most of the projects activities and functions, including the assignment and control of project resources, and key decision-making authority. Though some functional managers will have some input into the assignment of personnel from their departments. This matrix structure also allows for open communication and knowledge sharing within the work group, while also allowing employees to communicate across the boundaries, creating a pleasant, cooperative, work environment that helps in integrating the organization.
